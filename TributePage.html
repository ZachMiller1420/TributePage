    Here is a some information about Johnny Cash's  life.
<p> <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_CashJohn">Johnny</a> R. Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 â€“ September 12, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow,
     moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his 
     Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison 
     concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname "The Man in Black".</p>
<p> Born to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after four years in the Air Force. He 
    traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, "Hello, I'm Johnny Cash",[c] followed by "Folsom Prison Blues", one of his signature songs. Alongside
     "Folsom Prison Blues", his other signature songs include "I Walk the Line", "Ring of Fire", "Get Rhythm", and "Man in Black". He also recorded humorous numbers like 
     "One Piece at a Time" and "A Boy Named Sue", a duet with his future wife June called "Jackson" (followed by many further duets after their wedding), and railroad songs such 
     as "Hey, Porter", "Orange Blossom Special", and "Rock Island Line". During the last stage of his career, he covered songs by contemporary rock artists of the time; his most 
     notable covers were "Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails, "Rusty Cage" by Soundgarden, and "Personal Jesus" by Depeche Mode.</p>
<p>Cash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll,
     rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.
